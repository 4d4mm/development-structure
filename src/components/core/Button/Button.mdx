# Button

The button extends creates map between our application and the framework we use 
in this case Material UI. Therefore, references to the external framework can 
only occure in this folder (components). Notice that this is still an abstract 
component. Please see the contrast between the MenuButton component which is an 
exact implementation which we has a specific place on the UI. The MenuButon 
configures the generic/abstract button component. 


In sort on this level of abstraction:
- the basic components from external framework will be finetuned to the project's need.
- style options will be reduced to the use-cases occuring in te project.

Therefore if the developers decide to use a different UI framework or just to lean down 
the implementation only one part of the application has to be touched. Also, in case of 
this change for the custom functionality the already implemented test cases will not be 
lost, ergo less aspects of the codebase to test write new tests.
